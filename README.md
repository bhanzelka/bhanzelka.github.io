# Welcome to Braxden's Portfolio

![Me](/Braxden%20Hanzelka.jpg)

Hi, my name is Braxden Hanzelka and I am a graduating senior (Class of 2021) at Westminster College.  I'm a Utah native and I have spent the last 22 years getting my hands on anything with a motor or anything that uses electricity.  

I knew very early on that my itch for computers wouldn't be satisifed until I know the complete ins and outs of the system.  Because of this, I decided to puruse my Bachelor's in Computer Science to help get that deeper understanding that I was longing for.  As I near the completion of my degree, I confidently say : 
>“The more I learn, 
>the more I realize 
>how much I don't know” - Albert Einstein.

I plan to continue my learning after graduation as well as pursue a job in software development.  Most importantly, I am going to spend some time with myself and go for many top down drives in my current project car.  If you want to stay up to date on where I am heading or what I am driving, feel free to check out my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/braxdenhanzelka/). 

## Project Portfolio

### [Smash Stats](https://github.com/bhanzelka/Smash-Stats)

Smash Stats is my attempt at what I believe the statistics tracking should be for the game Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. The goal of this project was to get my feet wet with my first full stack application.  Throughout the development of Smash Stats, I took many different routes and ultimately ended up building the application with Node, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  Although this application isn't perfect, I am happy with the progress that was made on it and ultimately it will be converted to a mobile app.

I plan to take  the orginizational and developmental skills I learned on this project and apply them to any application I am involved with going forward.  This project was also directly related to a few of the Westminster College wide learning goals.  The ones in particular are : Critical Thinking and Creativity.  When developing a full stack application, you are in charge of every part of the application from start to finish.  This requires the ability to both creatively and critically think when desiging your application.

I also believe that this project touches on the CS department goal : "To understand the concepts and techniques of object-oriented software design."  I wouldn't have been able to even attempt a project like this if it wasn't for all of the concepts and techinques that I have learned throughout my degree.  I felt like ultimately I was prepared for the project thanks to the previous classes. 

This project addressed the computer science learning goals : 
1. **To understand the concepts and techniques of object-oriented software design**
2. **Develop effective problem-solving skills.**

### [One Time Pad Encryption](https://github.com/bhanzelka/CMPTsecurityHW3) 

This is an assignment that I completed during my Computer Security course at Westminster College.  This application features one time pad encryption and decryption.  I find OTP's particularly interesting because they cannot be cracked or brute forced unless you have the original shared key.  The application is simple to use, you input your message and your key that is of the same length or greater length than the message you want to encrypt.  Afterwards, the program will output your message in both plain text and cypher text.  

This project addressed the computer science learning goals : 
1. **Attaining a system-level understanding of the computer**
2. **Develop effective problem-solving skills.**

### [Spelic](https://github.com/BernardKintzing/Spelic) 

Spelic is a spelling game that was designed to teach elementary students grades 1 through 5 how to spell.  This project was completed in a team during my Software Engineering course at Westminster.  The project was written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript and was hosted through firebase.   We also used firebase for our real time database to store each invidudual student's progress.  We even had an admin mode that functions as a teacher view with eleveated privileges compared to the basic student account.

Spelic was one of the first web application that I worked on in a group setting.  I didnt know this at the time, but the knowledge learned from this assignment was invaluable when trying to create my own web application.  This project also helped to strengthen my group project skills in a way that I wasn't used to with other group assignments.  This was different than my other experiences because this project spanned a whole semester rather than a couple weeks.  Prior to this project, I was acustomed to working with other individuals, however these were often short term relations.  This project taught me the skills necessary to communicate with my team in order to stay on track as well on task throughout the semester.

This project was also directly applicable to one of Westminster's college wide learning goals : Collaboration.  Because we worked in a group for the duration of a semester, I really felt like I was apart of a real software development team.  This is also directly related to one of the CS department goals : "To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting."  As soon as I am in the workforce, I will be doing exactly what I did in software engineering, making these collaboration skills invaluable.

This project addressed the computer science learning goals : 
1. **To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.**
2. **Develop effective problem-solving skills.**

### [Chatroom Application](https://github.com/bhanzelka/Chatroom-Application)

This chatroom application was developed in my Computer Networks class.  This project was slowly built off of many other projects that eventually led to a full fledge chatroom application.  This application was developed alongside Augustine Valdez, and ultimately we are both proud of the results.  We even tested our application with the rest of the students who implented the same HTTP protocol as us.  

To our surprise, we were able to use our client to connect to the other chatrooms.  After connected, the application worked like a chat app should, even providing the option for private messaging.  This was one of my favorite assignments at Wesminster because I was able to use my program to interact with other programs that Westminster students made.  Not only that, this application gave me a deeper understanding of protocols and their importance.  So long as you are following a strict set of rules, you'll be able to "talk" with others implementing that protocol.

This project addressed the computer science learning goals : 
1. **Attaining a system-level understanding of the computer**
2. **Develop effective problem-solving skills.**

### [Recipies Database](https://github.com/bhanzelka/Recipes)

This simple application allows you to access, edit, store, and delete recipies electronically.  All of this was done in conjunction with two other students for my final project in databases.  Although a cliché example, I have found this database to actually be quite useful for other projects I have completed.  It taught me the fundamentals of database management from start to finish.  I have been able to use my database development skills in other projects that I have completed, most notably my Senior Capstone Project and Spelic.  This was a really fun project, and a great way to get my feet wet learning about Database Management. 

This project addressed the computer science learning goals : 
1. **Attaining a system-level understanding of the computer**
2. **To acquire significant project experience working both individually and in a group setting.**
