# Welcome to Braxden's Portfolio

![Me](/Braxden%20Hanzelka.jpg)

Hi, my name is Braxden Hanzelka and I am a graduating senior (Class of 2021) at Westminster College.  I'm a Utah native and I have spent the last 22 years getting my hands on anything with a motor or anything that uses electricity.  

I knew very early on that my itch for computers wouldn't be satisifed until I know the complete ins and outs of the system.  Because of this, I decided to puruse my Bachelor's in Computer Science to help get that deeper understanding that I was longing for.  As I near the completion of my degree, I confidently say  
>“The more I learn, 
>the more I realize 
>how much I don't know” - Albert Einstein.

I plan to continue my learning after graduation as well as pursue a job in software development.  Most importantly, I am going to spend some time with myself and go for many top down drives in my current project car.  If you want to stay up to date on where I am heading or what I am driving, feel free to check out my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/braxdenhanzelka/).
