# Welcome to Braxden's Portfolio

![Me](/Braxden%20Hanzelka.jpg)

Hi, my name is Braxden Hanzelka and I am a graduating senior (Class of 2021) at Westminster College.  I'm a Utah native and I have spent the last 22 years getting my hands on anything with a motor or anything that uses electricity.  

I knew very early on that my itch for computers wouldn't be satisifed until I know the complete ins and outs of the system.  Because of this, I decided to puruse my Bachelor's in Computer Science to help get that deeper understanding that I was longing for.  As I near the completion of my degree, I confidently say  
>“The more I learn, 
>the more I realize 
>how much I don't know” - Albert Einstein.

I plan to continue my learning after graduation as well as pursue a job in software development.  Most importantly, I am going to spend some time with myself and go for many top down drives in my current project car.  If you want to stay up to date on where I am heading or what I am driving, feel free to check out my [Instagram Page](https://www.instagram.com/braxdenhanzelka/). 

## Project Portfolio

### Smash Stats

Smash Stats is my attempt at what I believe the statistics tracking should be for the game Super Smash Brothers Ultimate. The goal of this project was to get my feet wet with my first full stack application.  Throughout the development of Smash Stats, I took many different routes and ultimately ended up building the application with Node, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.  Although this application isn't perfect, I am happy with the progress that was made on it and ultimately it will be converted to a mobile app.

I plan to take  the orginizational and developmental skills I learned on this project and apply them to any application I am involved with going forward. 

### [One Time Pad Encryption](https://github.com/bhanzelka/CMPTsecurityHW3) 

This is an assignment that I completed during my Computer Security course at Westminster College.  This application features one time pad encryption and decryption.  I find OTP's particularly interesting because they cannot be cracked or brute forced unless you have the original shared key.  The application is simple to use, you input your message and your key that is of the same length or greater length than the message you want to encrypt.  Afterwards, the program will output your message in both plain text and cypher text.  

### [Spelic](https://github.com/BernardKintzing/Spelic) 

Spelic is a spelling game that was designed to teach elementary students grades 1 through 5 how to spell.  This project was completed in a team during my Software Engineering course at Westminster.  The project was written in CSS, HTML, and Javascript and was hosted through firebase.   We also used firebase for our real time database to store each invidudual student's progress.  We even had an admin mode that functions as a teacher view with eleveated privileges compared to the basic student account.
